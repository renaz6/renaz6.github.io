    <h1 style = "color:white;">Concept</h3>
    <p>To document NASA's Mars Missions in an exhibit that strikes a balance between a traditional museum experience and elaborate technology.<br>
        I decided that to display so much information in a small space, I had to create four differently "themed" areas that used different strategies to capture the guests' attention. <br>
        As for color and design, I wanted to choose a pallette that was subtly evocative of space travel, Mars, and patriotism.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h1 style = "color:white;">Planning & Diagrams</h3>
        <p>Since I decided to only use rear-projection, one of the challenges I had was finding locations to house the projectors. My solution to this was to build "projection closets," which would
            have one wall as the rear-projection screen so that the projectors could be out of sight for the exhibit. </p>

    <h1 style = "color:white;">Execution</h3>
        <p>The final presentation was done using a 1/2 inch model box of the exhibition space. Full video coming soon.</p>
