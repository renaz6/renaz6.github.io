    <p> According to the prompt given by my professor, this is a short film about being an artist,
         but it's mostly about being anxious and how that can stop you from being an artist.</p>

    <h1 style = "color:white;">Concept</h1>
        <p>Though the story itself has gone through many iterations, the general concept has remained the same. 
            I wanted to portray how mental illness—anxiety specifically—can hinder the artistic process. I was inspired by my 
            own struggles with the vicious cycle of anxiety and how my own mind can sometimes stop me from doing the things I want 
            to do.

    <h1 style = "color:white;">Challenges</h1>
    <p> There are a plethora of challenges that come with making a film with no budget. My biggest challenge was lighting. Since I 
        did not have the means to rent lighting equipment, I had to use all practicals--lamps, windows, etc. Another difficulty I faced was coloring.
        Though most of the editing process was simple for me since I have had some prior exposure to Premier, I had a difficult time with the color of the film.
