    </h2>
    <p> This was my first attempt at animating via After Effects. 
        My goal was to play with and use as many effects that AE has to offer in 90 seconds.</p>

    <h1 style = "color:white;">Concept</h1>
        <p> This project was used to display my new knowledge of working in After Effects. I wanted to create something interesting and mechanical
            to pay homage to this song by Daft Punk.
