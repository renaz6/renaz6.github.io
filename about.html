                the intersection of technology and art. I want to utilize my knowledge of computer systems and programming to tell stories, 
                entertain, and evoke emotions. For now my two worlds--technology and art--exist mostly seperate. This website will document 
                my journey to combine those two passions of mine. <br> <br>I am currently enrolled as a Computer Science student at The 
                University of Texas with expectations to graduate in December of 2020. I have intern experience in backend technologies 
                with Cocolevio, Comcast, and Walt Disney World.
