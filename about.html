    <h1 >About</h1>
    <p>I am a software engineer who resides at the intersection of technology and art. I want to utilize my knowledge of computer systems and programming to tell stories, entertain, and evoke emotions. For now my two worlds--technology and art--exist mostly separate. This website will document my journey to combine those two passions of mine. <br>

        <br>I am currently enrolled as a student at The University of Texas with expectations to graduate in December of 2020. I am majoring in Computer Science with a certificate
        in Digital Arts and Media and a minor in Art History. I have intern experience in backend technologies with Cocolevio, Comcast, and Walt Disney World. 

        <br> <br>I want to live as fully and authentically as possible. </p>
